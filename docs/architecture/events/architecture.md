# Events Architecture

This page describes how event logic is organized.

## Core Components

- Event state orchestration: `src/core/EventCache.ts`
- Event indexing and lookup: `src/core/EventStore.ts`
- Event normalization pipeline: `src/core/EventEnhancer.ts`
- Recurrence behavior: `src/features/recur_events/`
- Event modal and edit form UI: `src/ui/modals/EditEvent.tsx` (implemented as a clean, divider-free layout with collapsible Advanced Options via HTML5 details)

## Design Boundaries

- UI actions trigger changes, but EventCache owns event state.
- Recurrence logic is delegated to dedicated feature managers.
- Provider write operations are routed through provider registry.
- **Frontmatter is the authoritative source for event identity.** The `title:` field in a note's YAML frontmatter is what appears on the calendar. Filenames are purely for file organisation and must never be used as the primary source of truth for event titles or identity. All local provider read paths (`FullNoteProvider`, `BasesProvider`, `FrontmatterCardDecorator`) must apply the same resolution order: frontmatter `title:` first, cleaned basename via `extractCleanTitleFromBasename()` as fallback.
- **Vault renames must trigger both delete and re-index.** When `vault.on('rename')` fires, the handler must call `handleFileDelete(oldPath)` followed by `handleFileUpdate(newFile)`. Relying solely on `metadataCache.on('changed')` is insufficient because that event only fires on content edits, not renames.
- Recurring instance completion/skip semantics are exposed through provider-agnostic contracts and implemented inside providers (no provider-specific recurrence branching in shared UI/core paths).
- Provider-specific recurring overrides are declared through `CalendarProviderCapabilities.ownsRecurringInstanceOverrides`. Shared recurrence code checks that capability instead of hardcoding provider types.
- CalDAV recurrence overrides are edited inside the shared server `.ics` object. Updating or deleting one override must replace or remove only the matching `VEVENT` with the same `UID` and `RECURRENCE-ID`; it must not PUT a one-event calendar over the whole resource or DELETE the resource URL.
- Recurring deletes are centralized in `RecurringEventManager.handleDelete`. Any GUI path that calls `EventCache.deleteEvent()` for a recurring master or linked override must show the same recurring-delete modal unless the caller explicitly uses `force`.
- Dragging or resizing a recurring occurrence opens `RescheduleRecurringModal`, allowing either an occurrence override or a whole-sequence update. Single events bypass this modal and use the normal update path. Rescheduling a single instance creates an isolated single-event override linked to the parent series to prevent recurrence rule leakage into the child or future occurrences.
- **Drag & resize lossless invariant**: Modifying event times or durations via drag-and-drop or resize handlers (`ViewEventInteractionHandler`) must strictly preserve all non-time attributes—including multiline `description`, `location`, categories, and custom note frontmatter—without accidental field drops or destructive rewrites.
- **Location URL context action**: The context menu evaluates `event.location` via `isValidUrl()` to expose a top-level `location:open-url` action across all providers and editability levels, launching valid URLs directly in the default browser.
- ICS serialization treats both internal recurrence shapes as provider-recurring data: `type: rrule` is serialized from its raw `rrule`, and `type: recurring` is converted into an RFC 5545 `RRULE` before writing to CalDAV/ICS providers.
- Video conference and linkification support is implemented in a provider-agnostic, schema-unmodified manner. Remote meeting URLs (e.g. from Google Calendar's `conferenceData`, Outlook's `onlineMeetingUrl`, iCalendar's `CONFERENCE` or X-properties) are extracted at the parser stage and merged into the canonical `location` or `description` fields using a shared helper `injectMeetingUrl` (empty location gets the URL; non-empty location appends the URL to the description). In the UI, the `linkify` utility recursively splits text on HTTP/HTTPS bounds to render clickable `<a>` tags.
