## Key implementation notes

### Full Note Provider

Creates one-note-per-event records, supports full CRUD, and uses robust filename collision handling to avoid destructive overwrites.

**Frontmatter-first event identity**: The plugin treats frontmatter as the authoritative source for all event data. The note's filename is used only for file organisation and is never the basis for what is displayed on the calendar. Specifically:

- **Date Resolution**: `getEventsInFile()` checks `frontmatter.date`, falling back to `due`, `scheduled`, `start`, or `startDate` if `date` is absent.
- **Task Inference**: Notes with `isTask: true`, `task: true`, `completed` (boolean or date), `due`, or `scheduled` are automatically inferred as calendar tasks (`isTask: true`).
- **Title Extraction**: `getEventsInFile()` reads the `title:` field from frontmatter. If absent or empty, it falls back to `extractCleanTitleFromBasename()` (`src/providers/utils/noteUtils.ts`), which strips known auto-generated prefixes before using the filename as a fallback title:
    - ISO date prefix (e.g. `2026-09-05 Meeting` → `Meeting`)
    - Recurrence prefix (e.g. `(Every M,W) Standup` → `Standup`)
    - Unique suffix (e.g. `Meeting-_-_-1` → `Meeting`)
- **Event UID**: Always set to `file.path` after parsing (`event.uid = file.path`). This is the stable persistent identifier — not the title, not the filename stem.
- **Recursive Scanning**: `getEvents()` recursively gathers all notes in subdirectories inside the configured calendar folder.

**Vault rename & cache handling**:
- `main.ts` listens for `vault.on('rename')` and handles both `TFile` and `TFolder` renames. For folder renames, it recursively deletes old child paths and triggers updates for all nested files.
- `metadataCache.on('resolve')` is registered in addition to `'changed'`, ensuring metadata updates triggered upon file renames are indexed immediately.
- `ObsidianIO.read(file)` falls back to direct disk reads (`vault.read(file)`) if `vault.cachedRead(file)` throws or returns an empty string during rename propagation.
- Existing `isBulkUpdating` guard in `CacheSyncHandler` prevents double-processing when the plugin itself renames files via `updateEvent()`.

**`basenameFromEvent` / `filenameForEvent`**: These remain in use for *creating* new event notes and for deciding if a file should be renamed when a user edits title or date via the modal. They are intentionally **not** used for reading.

**Location & Description Mapping**: Parses and writes `location` (geographic/logical address) and `description` (multiline text) dynamically inside the note's YAML frontmatter block.

**Frontmatter Serialization & Colon Safety**: All string properties in frontmatter are escaped and double-quoted by default when serialized (`escapeYamlString` in `frontmatter.ts` and `noteUtils.ts`). This prevents unquoted colons (`title: Super: Event`) from breaking Obsidian's YAML metadata parser. When reading note files, `getEventsInFile` utilizes `parseFrontmatterWithFallback` if Obsidian's `metadataCache` fails or returns unparsed metadata due to unquoted colons in historical or manually-edited notes.

**Recurrence rules**: Supports weekly, monthly (including specific weekday `repeatOn`), yearly, and daily (`fcrDaily` with optional `repeatInterval`) recurring events. Files for daily recurring events are named with `(Every day)` or `(Every X days)` to provide clean visual identification.

### Daily Note Provider

Parses list items under configured heading and performs line-targeted updates. Implements a persistent locally-allocated `uid` mechanism (`[uid:: N]`) instead of legacy deduplication matching, enabling deterministic title edits and O(1) hinted line lookups during sync updates.

Note lookup and creation are delegated through a source adapter:

- `ObsidianDailyNoteSourceAdapter` preserves the existing `obsidian-daily-notes-interface` integration for core Daily Notes and Periodic Notes.
- `JournalsDailyNoteSourceAdapter` consumes a `JournalsBridge`, selects a configured Day journal, and delegates resolution/creation to that exact journal. Journals remains optional and owns its folder, naming, template, and frontmatter initialization.

`JournalsBridge` is the only compatibility boundary. It prefers Journals 3.2+'s `obsidian-journals-api` locator and documented asynchronous surface, then falls back to the capability-checked Journals 2.x runtime. Provider and UI code do not branch on plugin version strings or private 3.x fields. The official adapter uses `listJournals({ writeType: "day" })`, `notesFor`, `journalOf`, and `ensureNote`; exact journal-name selectors preserve multiple-Day-journal isolation. The legacy adapter retains `journals`, `getJournal`, `index`, and `journal.open` behavior for 2.x.

Both adapters feed the same heading parser, serializer, UID allocator, and CRUD implementation. The 3.2 API makes note operations asynchronous, so CRUD awaits bridge results. FCR's synchronous event-handle and file-relevance contracts use only a selected-journal path/date cache hydrated by authoritative API reads and maintained by `noteAdded`/`noteRemoved` subscriptions. Provider teardown disposes those subscriptions during source reload and plugin unload. `journalRenamed` migrates every matching persisted `journalId`; Journals defines the journal name itself as identity.

Journals 3.2 does not expose journal templates through its public API. Heading suggestions therefore come from headings in existing selected-journal notes, while manual heading entry remains available. The 2.x adapter continues to inspect its public-at-runtime template settings for the legacy UX.

Daily Notes and Journals have independent persisted source discriminators (`dailynote` and `journals`). `JournalsProvider` reuses `DailyNoteProvider` as its date-note CRUD base, while remaining separately registered so multiple selected Day journals can coexist without participating in the single Daily Note source limit. Legacy Journals sources saved as `type: dailynote` plus `provider: journals` are migrated to `type: journals`.

**Location & Description Mapping**: Serializes `location` and `description` into Dataview inline attribute format (`[location:: My Location]  [description:: My Description]`) within the daily note bullet list items.

Timed-event serialization is source-configured and provider-owned:

- `default`: writes inline Dataview time fields such as `[startTime:: 02:30]` and `[endTime:: 03:30]`
- `dayPlanner`: writes a strict prefixed title form: `HH:mm - HH:mm Title`

Read behavior must stay format-agnostic:

- First prefer inline `startTime` and `endTime` fields when present.
- Only if those fields are absent, fall back to strict `HH:mm - HH:mm Title` parsing.
- Do not couple read behavior to the provider's configured write format.

This split allows forward writes to follow the selected provider format while preserving compatibility with older daily-note lines and mixed historical data.

### ICS Provider (non-standard hybrid)

Single provider supports both remote URLs (`http`, `https`, `webcal`) and local vault `.ics` files. It is intentionally read-only and normalizes remote/local acquisition into one contract surface.

Timezone and recurrence edge handling rationale is documented in [RRULE Timezone Date-Shift Fix](../dev-logs/devlog_rrule_timezone_patch.md).

### CalDAV Provider (protocol patch behavior)

Uses direct `REPORT`/`GET` flow with robust XML namespace handling and fallback retrieval paths when calendar-data is not returned inline. This is intentionally defensive due to server variability.

#### Legacy mixed VTODO & VEVENT dual-REPORT architecture
- **Dual-REPORT Strategy:** Under the CalDAV RFC 4791 specification, time-range queries cannot filter for both `VEVENT` and `VTODO` components using a logical `OR` condition within a single `calendar-query` report, because sibling `comp-filter` elements are logically ANDed. To query both component types efficiently and standard-compliantly, the provider executes two sequential `REPORT` queries: one for `VEVENT` and one for `VTODO`.
- **Fallback Avoidance:** If a server does not support standard `REPORT` queries and triggers a compatibility `PROPFIND` fallback (which fetches all files in the collection), the provider flags `fellBack = true` and skips the second `VTODO` `REPORT` query entirely, as the fallback has already fetched all objects (both events and tasks) in a single request.
- **Component-preserving writes:** New task-model items serialize through the VTODO codec; ordinary events continue through the VEVENT formatter. Updating an existing task uses `GET → VTODO patch → conditional PUT`, keyed by UID, so an all-day task cannot regress into a VEVENT when edited through Full Calendar.
- **Explicit component conversion:** Task identity in the submitted model selects the target component. VTODO → VTODO updates patch the fetched resource and preserve unmapped/server properties; VEVENT → VTODO and VTODO → VEVENT conversions serialize a fresh target component because the original resource has no component of that type to patch.
- **Location invariant:** ICS parsing maps `LOCATION` into `OFCEvent.location`; `toEventInput`/`fromEventApi` carry it through FullCalendar interactions; VEVENT and VTODO serializers write it back. Drag, resize, conversion, and modal edits must therefore preserve imported locations instead of silently clearing them.
- **Content Deduplication:** All retrieved calendar objects are combined and deduplicated based on their raw ICS payload content to eliminate any overlaps.
- **Compatibility:** Existing `caldav` sources keep this mixed read path so saved configurations require no migration.

#### CalDAV Tasks provider

- **Source isolation:** `caldavtasks` registers `CalDAVTaskProvider`, which requests only `VCALENDAR > VTODO`. Compatibility fallbacks are filtered through the VTODO codec so `VEVENT` resources cannot enter the task source.
- **Shared infrastructure:** The provider subclasses the existing CalDAV provider and reuses Basic authentication, SecretStorage IDs, collection validation, XML parsing, REPORT/PROPFIND fallback retrieval, href resolution, backlog scheduling, and request handling.
- **Protocol model:** `vtodo.ts` maps DTSTART-first placement while retaining DTSTART and DUE independently in `OFCEvent.icalTask`. It also retains status, percent complete, completion time, priority, RRULE, created, and last-modified metadata.
- **Safe writes:** Create emits `VCALENDAR + VTODO`. Update performs GET → component patch → conditional PUT, preserving UID, resource href, ETag, RRULE, nested alarms, timezone components, and unmapped/X-properties. Completion writes `STATUS:COMPLETED`, `PERCENT-COMPLETE:100`, and `COMPLETED`; reopening removes `COMPLETED` and resets percent complete.
- **Undated tasks:** The provider implements `TaskBacklogProvider`; VTODOs without valid DTSTART/DUE remain available in the unified backlog instead of entering FullCalendar rendering.
- **Recurrence boundary:** Existing RRULEs render and survive unrelated edits. Recurrence creation/change and per-instance VTODO writes remain intentionally unsupported.


### Google Provider

Uses OAuth-backed authenticated requests, handles recurrence exception/override edge cases (both modified and cancelled instances, for both timed and all-day occurrences, are parsed and merged into the master event's `skipDates`), and keeps provider-facing payload conversion isolated in parser/auth modules.

**Location & Description Mapping**: Directly maps the canonical `location` and `description` string properties to/from Google's native API event resource fields.

For token and permission boundaries, see [API Architecture](../system/api-architecture.md).

### Google Tasks Provider

Integrates with the Google Tasks API for complete two-way synchronization of tasks. It shares the existing Google Calendar authentication infrastructure (so connected Google accounts appear once in the integrations settings, but Google Tasks is configured as a separate calendar system).

**Key Integration and Behavior Characteristics:**
- **Zero-Impact Backlog Integration:** Satisfies the `TaskBacklogProvider` interface to automatically feed undated/incomplete tasks into the sidebar backlog view.
- **Drag-and-Drop Scheduling:** Handles moving undated backlog items onto the calendar by setting their `due` date.
- **Single-Event Mappings:** Tasks are strictly mapped to `single` OFCEvent structures since the Google Tasks API only supports single due dates and does not natively support complex event recurrences.
- **Scope-per-Flow with Union Preservation:** Each OAuth flow requests only the scopes its provider needs (`CALENDAR_SCOPES` for Google Calendar, `TASKS_SCOPES` for Google Tasks), both including the standard `email` scope for OIDC account identification. However, because Google replaces an account's full token on every authorization, `startGoogleLogin` merges in the `grantedScopes` already stored on every existing `GoogleAccount` before building the auth URL. This guarantees that re-authorizing one provider never revokes another provider's access on the same Google account. The resolved union is stored back on `GoogleAccount.grantedScopes` by `GoogleAuthManager.addAccount` after each successful OAuth exchange, so the state is always current even across multiple re-authorizations.

### Outlook Provider

Uses OAuth Authorization Code + PKCE with proxy-backed token and refresh exchange. Parsing and payload mapping are isolated in parser/auth modules similar to Google provider boundaries.

Outlook provider intentionally normalizes nullable Graph recurrence linkage (`seriesMasterId`) into optional event fields expected by core validation.

Current limitation: recurring single-instance override write path is not yet implemented.

### Tasks Provider (non-standard surgical writer)

Not a simple calendar source: it integrates with Tasks plugin cache, supports task-completion toggles, time-token parsing in task text, and surgical markdown line rewrites while preserving task metadata patterns.

Full flow and invariants are detailed in [Tasks Integration Architecture](tasks-integration.md).

#### Tasks date-field integration contract

The Tasks integration has two explicit date-field settings:

- `settings.tasksIntegration.backlogDateTarget` controls which incomplete tasks appear in the Tasks Backlog.
- `settings.tasksIntegration.calendarDisplayDateTarget` controls which Tasks date marker is used for calendar display and calendar event write-back.

Backlog filtering must use `backlogDateTarget`, not a hardcoded definition of "undated":

| Target          | Backlog filter                                   |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `scheduledDate` | Include incomplete tasks without `scheduledDate` |
| `startDate`     | Include incomplete tasks without `startDate`     |
| `dueDate`       | Include incomplete tasks without `dueDate`       |

Calendar display and write-back must use `calendarDisplayDateTarget` with no fallback:

| Target          | Calendar display                | Markdown write-back              |
| --------------- | ------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| `scheduledDate` | Only tasks with `scheduledDate` | Write or replace `⏳ YYYY-MM-DD` |
| `startDate`     | Only tasks with `startDate`     | Write or replace `🛫 YYYY-MM-DD` |
| `dueDate`       | Only tasks with `dueDate`       | Write or replace `📅 YYYY-MM-DD` |

Backlog filter UI entry points must use the same `backlogDateTarget` setting:

- Settings -> Integrations -> Obsidian Tasks Integration.
- The dropdown in the Tasks Backlog view header.

Changing the setting must save plugin settings and call `providerRegistry.refreshBacklogViews()` so all open backlog views re-query the provider. Backlog filtering belongs in `TasksPluginProvider.getUndatedTasks()` because the provider owns the Tasks cache shape and the date-field mapping. UI components should not duplicate that filtering logic.

Calendar event drag/update behavior writes `calendarDisplayDateTarget`. Backlog drag/drop writes `calendarDisplayDateTarget` and also writes `backlogDateTarget` when it differs, so a planned task no longer qualifies as a backlog candidate. Returning a task to the backlog clears both fields when they differ. `TasksPluginProvider._taskToOFCEvent()` must still read only `calendarDisplayDateTarget`; do not reintroduce scheduled/due/start fallback priority. Because event-cache contents are derived from the display field, changing `calendarDisplayDateTarget` may require an Obsidian restart or plugin reload for all open views to fully reflect the new policy.

The `openEditModalAfterBacklogDrop` setting gates the Tasks plugin edit modal after backlog drops. Its default is `false`, so the normal drag/drop path stays fast and non-blocking unless the user explicitly opts into the modal.

#### Tasks time-format contract

- `settings.tasksIntegration.taskDisplayFormat` controls how timed tasks are serialized back to markdown.
- Default is `dayPlanner` for new installs and forward writes.
- `standard` remains available as a compatibility/user preference mode.

Serialization modes:

| Mode         | Example output |
| ------------ | -------------- |
| `dayPlanner` | `- [ ] 5:00 - 19:00 Task title ⏳ 2026-05-02` |
| `standard`   | `- [ ] Task title (5:00 AM-7:00 AM) ⏳ 2026-05-02` |

Parsing must support both schemas regardless of the selected write mode. Do not introduce a read-mode switch tied to `taskDisplayFormat`.

### TaskNotes Provider (provider-owned NLP endpoint)

TaskNotes is a plugin-runtime integration provider and intentionally avoids HTTP transport. It reads from TaskNotes cache APIs and writes via TaskNotes service/UI endpoints.

Key contracts:

- Create behavior is provider-owned and configurable by source `dispatchMode`.
- Default dispatch endpoint is `search` (Search + Create selector flow).
- Alternate endpoint `create` opens TaskNotes create modal directly.
- Full Calendar NLP dispatch remains generic; provider decides endpoint semantics.

TaskNotes create delegation path:

```text
1. NLP resolves target and calls EventCache.addEvent (1)
2. Registry routes to TaskNotesProvider.createEvent (2)
3. Provider opens UI and throws DelegatedProviderActionError (3)
4. Cache handler rolls back optimistic state (4)
```

1.  Determines which calendar should handle the request based on the NLP result.
2.  The registry acts as the central router for all provider operations.
3.  The error signal tells the core that the action has been successfully handed off.
4.  Ensures no "ghost" events remain in the UI while the user is in the other plugin's modal.

This prevents duplicate modal UX and keeps provider-specific behavior outside dispatcher logic.

The mutation lifecycle this relies on is defined in [EventCache Contract](../system/eventcache.md#mutation-lifecycle-authoritative-path).

### Holiday Provider (virtual, bundled data)

Read-only provider that surfaces [date-holidays](https://github.com/commenthol/date-holidays) data as all-day `OFCEvent` objects. No vault file, no network request, no `EventLocation`.

**Architecture invariants:**

- `isRemote = false`, `loadPriority = 5` — loads in the first provider wave alongside local sources.
- CRUD methods (`createEvent`, `updateEvent`, `deleteEvent`, `createInstanceOverride`) unconditionally reject. `getCapabilities()` returns `{ canCreate: false, canEdit: false, canDelete: false }`.
- Events are typed `single`, `allDay: true`, `date: YYYY-MM-DD`, ID format `date-holidays:{date}:{name}`.
- **Timezone:** provider intentionally omits any timezone argument to `date-holidays`. All-day events carry no time component; the plugin's [`EventEnhancer`](../system/data-flow.md) applies the global display timezone uniformly. Passing a per-provider timezone here would cause double-correction.

**Cache model:**

Results are cached in `localStorage` keyed by a djb2 hash of `country|state|region|holidayTypes|display` plus year. TTL is 30 days. Hash change on config edit = automatic cache invalidation. `localStorage` failures are silently swallowed (plugin functions correctly; data is recomputed on next open).

**Config hash inputs** (`src/providers/holidays/HolidayProvider.ts` `_computeConfigHash`):

```
country | state | region | holidayTypes | display
```

**Source files:**

- `src/providers/holidays/HolidayProvider.ts` — provider class, cache layer, `OFCEvent` conversion
- `src/providers/holidays/ui/HolidayConfigComponent.tsx` — settings modal; links to [date-holidays country list](https://github.com/commenthol/date-holidays/blob/master/docs/Holidays.md) and [type specification](https://github.com/commenthol/date-holidays/blob/master/docs/specification.md#types-of-holidays) inline

### Obsidian Bases Provider

Read-only provider (`isRemote = false`, `loadPriority = 10`) that reads Obsidian `.base` schema definitions and extracts events from vault markdown files matching the specified Base query filters.

!!! info "Filter Evaluation Engine"
    Parses `.base` YAML configuration and evaluates nested `or`, `and`, and `not` logical filter trees against files:
    - `file.hasTag("tag")` — matches metadata cache tags (supporting `#tag` and `tag` syntax).
    - `file.inFolder("folder")` — checks prefix path matching against `file.path`.
    - `file.ext == "md"` — verifies markdown file extension.

**Frontmatter Field Extraction & Categorization**:
- Heuristically extracts event dates from frontmatter keys: `date`, `start`, `startTime`, or `due`.
- Extracts categories (`category`, `Category`) and sub-categories (`subCategory`, `SubCategory`, `sub category`).
- **Title resolution** follows the same frontmatter-first policy as `FullNoteProvider`: the `title:` frontmatter field is authoritative; if absent or empty, `extractCleanTitleFromBasename()` is used as a fallback (stripping date prefixes, recurrence prefixes, and unique suffixes before displaying the filename as a title).
- Synthesizes formatted event titles as `Category - SubCategory - Title` or `Category - Title` prior to passing through [`validateEvent()`](file:///d:/Codes/plugin-full-calendar/src/types.ts).
- Sets `event.uid` to `file.path` to enable O(1) persistent navigation back to the source note on click.

**Capability Contract**:
- All write operations (`createEvent`, `updateEvent`, `deleteEvent`, `createInstanceOverride`) unconditionally reject. `getCapabilities()` returns `{ canCreate: false, canEdit: false, canDelete: false }`.

**Source files:**

- [`src/providers/bases/BasesProvider.tsx`](file:///d:/Codes/plugin-full-calendar/src/providers/bases/BasesProvider.tsx) — provider class, filter evaluator, and `OFCEvent` conversion
- [`src/providers/bases/BasesConfigComponent.tsx`](file:///d:/Codes/plugin-full-calendar/src/providers/bases/BasesConfigComponent.tsx) — settings configuration component

## Cross-provider orchestration constraints

- Registry is the only runtime router for provider read/write operations.
- Providers expose capabilities (`canCreate`, `canEdit`, `canDelete`) and optional custom hooks (`toggleComplete`, `canBeScheduledAt`).
- Persistent event identity must be surfaced through `getEventHandle()` so global identifier mapping remains stable.

Provider contract and registration rules are specified in [Provider Architecture](architecture.md) and [Provider Blueprint](provider-blueprint.md).

## Provider-agnostic recurring instance semantics

Recurring-instance completion and skip behavior must remain provider-owned while the UI and core remain provider-agnostic.

Contract location:

- `src/providers/Provider.ts` defines `RecurringInstanceState` and optional `RecurringInstanceStateProvider` hooks.

Contract shape:

- `getRecurringInstanceState(event, instanceDate)` returns normalized state (`completed`, `skipped`) for a concrete instance date.
- `setRecurringInstanceState(event, instanceDate, nextState)` applies provider-owned persistence and returns success/failure.

Design goals:

- No provider-specific recurrence fields (for example backend-specific arrays or flags) may leak into generic UI logic.
- UI checkbox and styling logic must consume only normalized `RecurringInstanceState`.
- Mutation orchestration remains generic; provider adapters translate normalized state into backend-native operations.

### Rollout pattern for additional providers

When adding recurring-instance semantics to another provider (CalDAV, Google, Tasks, etc.), follow this sequence:

1. Keep provider-specific recurrence persistence internal to the provider implementation.
2. Implement `RecurringInstanceStateProvider` in that provider.
3. Map backend-native state to `RecurringInstanceState` in `getRecurringInstanceState(...)`.
4. Map normalized target state back to backend-native write operations in `setRecurringInstanceState(...)`.
5. Avoid introducing provider-type checks in shared UI/core pathways.

This no-provider-branching rule aligns with [Data Flow](../system/data-flow.md#flow-invariants) and [Events Architecture](../events/architecture.md#design-boundaries).

### Current adoption

- TaskNotes provider implements this contract and adapts TaskNotes recurring-instance APIs behind the generic interface.
- Existing providers that do not implement this optional interface continue to use legacy fallback behavior.
