This page highlights the latest **major features and improvements** to help you get the most out of the plugin.  
For a detailed version-by-version breakdown, see the [Changelog](changelog.md).


## 📔 First-Class Journals Calendar Provider

Full Calendar now features dedicated, first-class support for the **Obsidian Journals** community plugin alongside core Daily Notes.

*   **Multi-Journal Coexistence**: Connect multiple Day journals (e.g. Work, Personal, Research) as separate calendar sources, each with its own heading and color styling.
*   **Official Journals 3.2+ API**: Built on the official asynchronous `obsidian-journals-api` with automatic rename listeners and heading discovery from existing notes.
*   **Seamless Backward Compatibility**: Automatic settings migration from legacy configurations, with full fallback support for Journals 2.x runtimes.
*   **Zero File Bloat**: Entries are created cleanly through Journals' own template and date configuration only when events exist.

## 🗓️ Dedicated CalDAV Tasks Provider & Apple Reminders Sync

Manage tasks and to-dos stored as standard iCalendar `VTODO` resources independently from appointment calendars.

*   **Isolated Task Collection**: Add dedicated CalDAV task collections that strictly enforce RFC 5545 task semantics and keep tasks separated from appointment schedules.
*   **Apple Reminders Compatibility**: Tested with iCloud Reminders via CalDAV, preserving vendor-specific properties (`X-APPLE-*`) and handling complex alarm structures.
*   **Task Backlog Integration**: Undated tasks automatically feed into the unified [Task Backlog](user/features/tasks-backlog.md) for drag-and-drop scheduling onto the calendar grid.
*   **Conflict-Safe Synchronization**: Employs conditional HTTP headers (`If-Match` with quoted ETags and `If-None-Match: *`) to prevent overwriting edits made on other devices.

➡️ Learn more in **[CalDAV Tasks](user/calendars/caldav-tasks.md)** and **[CalDAV Calendar](user/calendars/caldav.md)**.

## 🌤️ Weather Forecast Integration

Plan your schedule in harmony with the weather! Full Calendar now includes a fully integrated, live weather forecast feature for your daily, weekly, and monthly views.

## 📋 Unified Task Backlog

The task backlog has been completely reimagined as a **generalized, multi-source task backlog framework**! It is now fully decoupled from specific integrations, adhering to strict SOLID design principles, and aggregates unscheduled tasks from multiple sources in a single aggregated side panel.

*   **Multi-Provider Aggregation**: Combine unscheduled work from Obsidian Tasks, CalDAV VTODO, and Google Tasks into one focused planning panel.
*   **Drag-and-Drop Scheduling**: Drag any supported backlog task onto the calendar to schedule instantly with provider-aware synchronization.
*   **Direct Task Creation**: Create remote tasks from the backlog UI for supported providers without leaving your planning flow.
*   **Event Linked Notes**: Clicking the note icon next to a backlog CalDAV task instantly generates and opens a local templates-driven markdown note, keeping your rich detail vault-local and your sync lightweight.

➡️ Learn more in **[Task Backlog](user/features/tasks-backlog.md)**, **[Tasks Integration](user/calendars/tasks-plugin-integration.md)**, **[Google Tasks](user/calendars/gtasks.md)**, and **[CalDAV](user/calendars/caldav.md)**.

## 🔗 Event Linked Notes

You can now link unique, template-driven Obsidian notes to your calendar events! This fully reactive system automatically manages association metadata and works seamlessly across both local and remote calendars (Google Calendar, CalDAV, ICS, Outlook).

*   **Template-Driven Body Creation**: Utilize a robust `TemplateEngine` to design custom, context-aware event note bodies and layouts.
*   **Seamless Interoperability**: Create, manage, and open linked notes for Google, CalDAV, ICS, and Outlook events with inline editor and event modal shortcuts.
*   **Settings Controls**: Easily configure directory targets and template files per calendar source.

You asked, we delivered. CalDAV calendars now support full two-way synchronization. Create, modify, and delete events from your private iCloud, Fastmail, or self-hosted CalDAV servers directly within Obsidian.

---

## ✅ CalDAV validation & Google recurrence fixes

CalDAV imports now verify that the URL is a real calendar collection via PROPFIND, with clearer errors when a non-calendar endpoint is pasted. Google Calendar recurring events respect their source timezone, hide deleted instances reliably, and the mobile OAuth flow opens a safe placeholder tab to avoid popup blockers.

---


## 🌐 Multi-Language Support

Full Calendar now supports multiple languages! The UI will automatically switch based on your Obsidian language setting. Developers can contribute new translations using the i18n system with type-safe keys.

## ✔️ Tasks Integration Reimagined

The integration with the **Obsidian Tasks plugin** has been completely overhauled for maximum performance and reliability. It's now faster, safer, and more intuitive than ever.

- **Live Sync with Tasks Cache:** No more slow vault scans. The calendar now syncs directly with the Tasks plugin's live cache for instant updates.
- **Surgical Edits:** Modifying a task (e.g., scheduling or completing it) no longer rewrites the entire line. The plugin surgically updates only the necessary parts, preserving your custom metadata like links, tags, and comments.
- **Robust Drag-and-Drop:** Drag tasks from the backlog or between dates with confidence. The new provider ensures that scheduling is reliable and predictable.
- **Seamless Experience:** Create, update, and complete tasks directly from the calendar. All changes are powered by the Tasks plugin's own engine for data integrity.

## 🎨 Powerful Advanced Categories & Coloring

Supercharge your calendar's organization with Advanced Categories! This new system allows you to override a calendar's default color for specific events based on a category prefix in the event's title. It's the foundation for many powerful features to come.

-   **Universal Organization:** Works for local and remote calendars. An event from Google Calendar titled `Work - Project Deadline` will be colored correctly in Obsidian.
-   **Sub-Categories:** Organize even further with a `Category - SubCategory - Title` format.

## ✨ Recurring Events Reimagined

The entire recurring event system has been rebuilt from the ground up to be more powerful, intuitive, and safe.

- **Per-Instance Editing:** Drag, resize, or rename a single occurrence of a recurring event without affecting the entire series. The plugin automatically creates a smart "override" that is linked to the parent.
- **Recurring Tasks That Work:** Check off a single instance of a recurring task as "done." It will be crossed out for that day only, leaving future occurrences ready for action.
- **Safe Deletion:** When deleting a recurring event, you'll now be asked whether you want to delete just that one instance, or the entire series (including any overrides you've made).

➡️ **[Learn more about Recurring Events & Overrides](user/events/recurring.md)**

-   **Display Timezone:** Set a specific timezone for your calendar view, independent of your system's timezone. Perfect for planning trips or coordinating with remote teams.
-   **Automatic Conversion:** Events from all sources—local notes, daily notes, and remote calendars like Google Calendar—are automatically converted to your chosen display timezone.
-   **DST Safe:** All conversions are Daylight Saving Time aware, so you never have to worry about "fall back" or "spring forward" bugs again.
