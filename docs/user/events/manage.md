# Manage events on the calendar

In addition to clicking on events to edit them directly, you can click-and-drag on events to change their characteristics as well.

## Moving events

Move an event around on a day or between days. This works just as well with all-day events.

- **Lossless Updates:** Dragging an event preserves all existing details—including multiline descriptions, locations, categories, and custom note frontmatter—without accidental overwrites.
- **Recurring Instance Overrides:** Moving a single occurrence of a recurring series creates an isolated single-event override, keeping the parent recurrence rule and all future dates intact.

## Drag to change duration

Drag the endpoint of an event to adjust its start or end time.

- Like moving, resizing preserves all event descriptions, locations, and custom metadata.
- Resizing a single occurrence of a recurring series safely isolates the change to that instance without altering the rest of the sequence.

!!! tip "Quick Context Menu Actions"
    In addition to direct click-and-drag interactions, right-clicking an event opens the [Context Menu](hover_context.md#right-click-context-menu) to launch meeting/location URLs in your browser, open linked notes, or delete specific occurrences.

## Creating and editing: validations and duplicates

When using the modal to create or edit an event, the plugin validates inputs in real time:

- Duplicate detection: If an event with the same date and final title would collide in its target calendar:
	- [Full Note calendars](../calendars/local.md): creation is blocked because the underlying filename would be identical (see below).
	- [Daily Note calendars](../calendars/dailynote.md): duplicates are not allowed; another list item with the same visible title on that date under the configured heading will be flagged.
	- Note: Duplicate checks in Daily Notes compare the visible title (category prefix is ignored if [Advanced Categories](categories.md) are enabled).
- Category-aware titles: If Advanced Categories are enabled, the Title field accepts "SubCategory - Title" and the Category is selected separately. The plugin reconstructs the full title when writing.
- Literal titles when disabled: If Advanced Categories are disabled, the Title field is treated as plain text and is not split by ` - `.

Limitations applied by calendar type during editing:

- [Daily Note calendars](../calendars/dailynote.md) do not support recurring events or multi-day single events.
- [Recurring instance overrides](recurring.md) inherit some properties (e.g., title/category) from the parent; attempting to edit those fields prompts to open the parent.

## Redesigned Event Modal UI

The Event Creation and Editing Modal has been redesigned to offer a modern, clean, and premium experience:

- **Unified, Clean Design**: Legacy grey horizontal dividing borders between form fields have been removed. The layout relies on native theme-consistent spacing to look cohesive and uncluttered.
- **Collapsible Advanced Options**: To keep the interface focused and simple, less frequently used configurations—such as **Display** (calendar appearance) and **Repeats** (recurrence patterns)—are grouped inside an **Advanced Options** panel at the bottom of the form. This panel is neatly styled and **folded/closed by default**.
- **Adaptive Spacing**: Spacing adapts cleanly whether Advanced Categories or Background Events are toggled on or off, keeping only the most relevant fields immediately visible.
- **Full Internationalization (i18n)**: The entire modal form, including tooltips, select presets, dropdown items, and placeholders, is fully translated across English, German, Spanish, French, Italian, and Chinese.

## Moving between calendars

- Currently, moving events is supported between Full Note calendars only. Moving to or from a Daily Note calendar is not supported.

## Video Conference & Linkification Support

When clicking on an event to view its details, the Event Details modal automatically linkifies URLs to make them clickable:

- **Universal Linkification**: Any valid HTTP/HTTPS URLs present in the event's `location` or `description` fields are rendered as clickable hyperlinks (`<a>` tags) instead of plain text, allowing you to open them directly in your default browser.
- **Auto-Injection of Video Conference Links**: When syncing with remote calendars, video conference links (such as Google Meet, Zoom, Webex, Microsoft Teams, Jitsi, or Discord) are extracted from their API-specific structures (like Google's `conferenceData` or Outlook's `onlineMeetingUrl`) or parsed from iCalendar properties.
  - If the event's `location` field is empty, the conference URL is stored directly in the `location` field.
  - If the event's `location` is already filled (e.g. with a physical room), the meeting link is cleanly appended to the end of the `description` field prefixed with `meeting URL:`.
