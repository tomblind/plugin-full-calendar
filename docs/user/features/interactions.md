# Interactions and Gestures

This page documents direct interactions in the calendar UI.

## Mouse and Trackpad

- Click empty date/time slot: create event.
- Click a date label or day number: open or create that day's Obsidian daily note. (Can be toggled via the **Open daily note on date click** setting under General Settings; Month view uses the day number link, and Week/Day views use the column header).
- Drag event: move event to a new day or time.
- Resize event edge: change event duration.
- Right-click event: open context actions.
- Right-click date or view area: open date navigation actions.
- Swipe left or right on the calendar grid (touch): move to next or previous range.

## Event Search (Toolbar)

- Use the search icon in the top toolbar (next to date navigation) to find events quickly.
- When inactive, only the icon is shown; clicking it expands the search input inline.
- Search filters events in-place across the current view and hides non-matching events.
- Press `Esc` to clear/collapse quickly, or use the clear button.
- When a search is active, the input shows a red glow so the filter state is obvious.

### Matching behavior

- Search is intentionally strict to reduce false positives.
- Exact/contiguous matches are prioritized.
- Small typos can still match for longer terms.
- Multi-word queries require each term to match.

## Keyboard Modifiers

- Left/Right arrow keys: previous or next range when the calendar view is focused.
- Arrow keys are ignored for calendar navigation while typing in inputs/editors.
- Ctrl/Cmd + click event: open the associated note directly. For remote events (Google, CalDAV, Outlook, ICS) this also **creates** the linked note when none exists yet, then opens it.
- Ctrl/Cmd + hover event: trigger note preview (requires Obsidian Page Preview support).
- Ctrl/Cmd + mouse wheel: zoom the time axis for supported views.

## Zoom Levels

The time grid supports multiple zoom levels and adjusts slot duration and label interval.

Typical progression in standard time-grid views:
- 1 hour
- 30 minutes
- 15 minutes
- 5 minutes

## Mobile Navigation

- On mobile, the month view uses compact event markers to reduce clutter while still keeping per-day occupancy visible.
- Supported day and 3-day views accept pinch-to-zoom gestures for faster density changes.
- Layout switching is grouped into the mobile `More` menu so the main toolbar stays readable on narrow screens.

## Context Menu Actions

- **Open location URL** — shown whenever the event's `location` holds a valid web URL. Opens it in your default system browser.

Editable events also include:
- Turn into task / Remove checkbox
- **Open linked note** — shown for remote events whose provider supports linked notes (Google, CalDAV, Outlook, ICS, Holidays). Creates the note on first use, opens it on subsequent uses.
- Go to note — shown for local note events (frontmatter / daily note sources).
- Delete

## Opening Linked Notes — Smart Tab Reuse

All paths that open a linked note (Ctrl/Cmd+click, context menu, event popup note button) share the same behaviour:

- **Existing tab reused**: if the note is already open in a tab, that tab is focused and brought to the front — no duplicate tabs.
- **Fresh tab for new notes**: a brand-new note (just created) always opens in a new tab, because it cannot already be open.
- **Recurring events**: the correct per-instance note is resolved automatically in both link strategies (deadline-based and name-based).
