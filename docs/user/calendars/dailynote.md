# Daily Note Calendar

Store events in-line in Daily Notes. Each event is a list item. Timed events can be written either with [Dataview inline fields](https://blacksmithgu.github.io/obsidian-dataview/data-annotation/) or in a strict DayPlanner-style prefix, depending on the format selected when you add the Daily Note calendar source.

[Tasks](../events/tasks.md) are supported with [checkboxes](https://help.obsidian.md/How+to/Format+your+notes) so you can easily track your to-dos for the day.

!!! tip "Power Up with Categories"
    Daily Note calendars also support **[Advanced Categories](../events/categories.md)**. You can add a category to your task list items (e.g., `- [ ] Work - Finish report`) to color-code your daily agenda.

## Prerequisites

You must be using one of the supported daily notes plugins in order to create a Daily Note calendar:

-   [Daily Notes core plugin](https://help.obsidian.md/Plugins/Daily+notes)
-   [Periodic Notes community plugin](https://github.com/liamcain/obsidian-periodic-notes)

To use the Obsidian Journals community plugin instead, add a separate [Journals calendar](journals.md).

## Configuring the Daily Notes calendar

Add a **Daily Note** calendar for core Daily Notes or Periodic Notes. Then choose:

- which heading from the configured template or templates events should be placed under
- which write format timed events should use

If your template does not have any headings, then you can enter free-form text to specify the heading that events will be placed under.

If a heading does not exist in a daily note, it will be appended to the end of the file before adding any events to it.

The heading can be changed later directly from the configured calendar row. When template headings are available, Full Calendar presents them as a dropdown.

Timed events support two write formats:

- Default: `- Learning - Reading - Grocery Run [uid:: 2]  [timezone:: Europe/Budapest]  [startTime:: 02:30]  [endTime:: 03:30]  [location:: Library]  [description:: Bring library card]`
- DayPlanner Format: `- 02:30 - 03:30 Learning - Reading - Grocery Run [uid:: 2]  [timezone:: Europe/Budapest]  [location:: Library]  [description:: Bring library card]`

The default format remains the inline-field layout.

The chosen format applies to new event creation and later edits written through that Daily Note source. If you want a different write format later, remove the Daily Note source and add it again with the other option. This does not change your existing notes by itself.

Note that only one daily note calendar can be active at a time.

## Limitations and behavior nuances

- Recurring events cannot be created or edited in Daily Notes. Use a Full Note calendar for recurring series.
- Multi-day single events (with an `endDate`) are not supported in Daily Notes.
- Duplicate titles on the same day are not allowed. The editor will warn if another item under the heading already has the same visible title for that date.
- Only one Daily Note calendar source is supported at a time in settings.
- Parsing remains backward-compatible across both timed-event formats. Full Calendar first prefers inline `[startTime::]` and `[endTime::]` fields, then falls back to the strict `HH:mm - HH:mm Title` DayPlanner prefix if those fields are absent.

## Multiple Daily Note Calendars

Daily Note calendars have a single-instance limitation: only one Daily Note calendar source can be active at a time in settings. This prevents conflicts when parsing and writing to daily notes.

If you need multiple date-note or note-based calendar sources, you can connect multiple Day journals using [Journals calendars](journals.md) (which allow multiple coexisting journal sources), or use [Full Note calendars](local.md) for folder-organized individual note events.

## Timezone handling (Daily Notes)

Daily Note calendars support two modes, configurable in Settings → General → Daily note timezone:

- Local (default): Event times are interpreted relative to your computer's current timezone and are not stamped into the line.
- Strict: Event times are stamped with the current Display Timezone and are treated as anchored timestamps when written back.

In both modes, events are rendered in the Display Timezone you choose for the calendar view.

## Navigation to Daily Notes

Enable **Open daily note on date click** in **Settings → General** to make Full Calendar's
visible date labels act as daily-note links. This remains opt-in for compatibility with
existing click and selection workflows.

### Click behavior

- In **Month** view, click the day number in the corner of a day cell.
- In **Week**, **Day**, and **3-day** views, click the formatted column header (for example,
  `Mon 7/9`).
- In **List** view, click either part of a day's heading; both represent the same daily note.
- If the daily note already exists, Full Calendar opens it in the current Obsidian leaf.
- If it does not exist, Full Calendar asks the active Daily Notes integration to create it,
  including the configured folder, date format, and template, and then opens the new file.
- The date is resolved in local calendar time, so the label you click is the date that opens.

This navigation uses Obsidian's **Daily Notes** core plugin or the supported **Periodic
Notes** plugin. Enable and configure one of those prerequisites first. A Daily Note calendar
source is not required merely to navigate from a date, although it is required if you want
Full Calendar events stored inside the notes.

### Hover preview

Hovering over the same date label displays Obsidian's standard Page Preview popover when the
daily note already exists. The popover renders the note's current contents just like links in
Markdown and linked calendar-event notes.

Hover is read-only: it never creates a file, runs a template, or modifies the vault. A date
whose note does not exist has nothing to preview. Click it to create the note, then hover the
date again to preview it. Obsidian's **Page Preview** core plugin must be enabled for the
popover to appear.

### Interaction boundaries

Left-clicking on the main day cell body in Month view will continue to open the "Create Event" modal.
Right-clicking a date continues to open Full Calendar's date navigation context menu. On
mobile Month view, tapping outside the day number continues to select the day and update the
agenda. Disabling **Open daily note on date click** removes both the click and hover behavior
from date labels without changing those other interactions.
