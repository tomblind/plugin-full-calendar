# Google Calendar Two-Way Sync

Easily add, edit, and delete events from your private Google Calendar directly in Obsidian using **OAuth 2.0 authentication**.

!!! success "Verified Integration"
    Full Calendar Remastered is an officially verified Google integration. You can now connect your accounts directly without creating your own Google Cloud credentials.

Calendars automatically refresh every **5 minutes**. To manually refresh calendars, run the [FCR Command](../features/nlp.md): `refresh calendars` or use the command `Full Calendar: Revalidate remote calendars`.

!!! tip "Power Up with Categories"
    Google Calendar events fully support [Advanced Categories](../events/categories.md). Use a title like `Personal - Doctor` to automatically apply your "Personal" color and styling.

## Feature Notes

- **Two-Way Sync**: Changes made in Obsidian (create, edit, delete) are instantly reflected in Google Calendar.
- **Google Tasks Coexistence**: Connecting [Google Tasks](gtasks.md) under the same Google account is fully safe. Each provider requests only its own OAuth permissions, and the plugin automatically preserves both providers' access — connecting Tasks never removes your Calendar authorization, and vice versa.
- **Video Conferencing**: Automatically extracts meeting links (e.g., Google Meet, Zoom) from `conferenceData` and injects them into the event's location or description (rendered as clickable hyperlinks in the [Event Details modal](../events/manage.md#video-conference--linkification-support)). See the [Video Conference & Linkification Guide](../events/manage.md#video-conference--linkification-support).
- **Recurring Events**: Supports exceptions and cancellations. Deleting a single instance in a series creates a proper "cancelled" instance in the Google API.
- **Timezone Management**: Events are normalized to your [Display Timezone](../settings/fc_config.md) while respecting the original source timezone for recurrence rules.
- **Event Linked Notes**: Keep rich local meeting notes or agendas connected directly to remote Google Calendar events with automated template population. Name-based mode reuses the exact sanitized title file; deadline-based mode can keep recurring occurrences separate. See the [Event Linked Notes Guide](../features/event-linked-notes.md) for details.
- **Mobile Support**: On iOS/Android, the login flow opens a browser tab to perform OAuth. If iOS Safari or Obsidian's environment blocks the popup window, Full Calendar automatically detects this and presents an interactive copy-paste authorization modal so you can complete sign-in without getting stranded.

## Troubleshooting & Manual Authorization

*   **Manual Authorization:** See the [Central Troubleshooting Guide](../guides/troubleshooting.md#google-calendar-authentication-manual-flow) for help with OAuth redirects, popup blocking fallbacks, and manual copy-paste login.
*   **Android and iOS Authentication Workaround:** For step-by-step instructions on authenticating Google Calendar/Tasks on mobile devices using vault synchronization, see [Mobile Authentication Workaround](../guides/troubleshooting.md#mobile-authentication-workaround).
