# Remote calendar from private iCloud or any CalDAV source

You can add any calendar that supports CalDAV over HTTPS basic authentication with a few providers already confirmed to work.

!!! info
	Paste the **calendar collection URL** (usually ending in `/events/`) when adding CalDAV. The plugin now validates the URL with a PROPFIND request and will reject endpoints that are not calendar collections.

Calendars are automatically re-fetched from their source at most every five minutes. If you would like to revalidate remote calendars directly, you can run the command `Full Calendar: Revalidate remote calendars`.

!!! tip "Power Up with Categories"
    CalDAV calendars also support **[Advanced Categories](../events/categories.md)**. You can add a category to your external events (e.g., `Personal - Dentist`) to color-code them across all your synced devices.

## Two-Way Sync and Timezone Behavior

- **Two-Way Sync:** CalDAV calendars now support full two-way synchronization. Changes made in Obsidian are pushed to the server, and remote changes are pulled in periodically.
- **Locations:** The event modal's location field maps to the iCalendar `LOCATION` property. Locations imported from the server remain attached after drag, resize, or edit operations; locations entered in Full Calendar are written back for both events and tasks.
- **Video Conferencing & Links:** Automatically parses the RFC 7986 `CONFERENCE` property and Microsoft Teams/Skype meeting URLs, mapping them into the event's location or description. All meeting links and general URLs are rendered as clickable hyperlinks in the [Event Details modal](../events/manage.md#video-conference--linkification-support). For details, see [Video Conference & Linkification Support](../events/manage.md#video-conference--linkification-support).
- **Task Support (VTODO):** Mixed CalDAV sources read both events and tasks. Turning a single event into a task writes a `VTODO`; removing task status changes it back to a `VEVENT`. Editing, moving, or renaming an imported task keeps it a `VTODO`, including date-only and scheduled tasks, while preserving server-specific task properties. For isolated task/reminder collections, completion controls, and stricter task-only validation, use the dedicated [CalDAV Tasks](caldav-tasks.md) source.
- **Timezones:** Events and tasks are parsed with their source timezone and converted to your Display Timezone for viewing.
- **Cancellations:** Cancellations/exceptions present on the server are respected.
- **Recurring exceptions:** Moving one occurrence creates an exception in the original CalDAV resource. That occurrence can be moved again later without changing the rest of the series.

## CalDAV Task Backlog / Inbox

CalDAV tasks (`VTODO` components) that do not have a scheduled or due date are parsed as **unscheduled backlog items**.

- **Unified Backlog Sidebar**: Open the **Task Backlog** sidebar (via command palette or ribbon icon) to view unscheduled CalDAV tasks mixed alongside your Obsidian Tasks in a single, aggregated panel.
- **Drag-and-Drop Scheduling**: You can drag any unscheduled CalDAV task from the sidebar backlog directly onto a date or time slot on the calendar. Full Calendar will automatically schedule it (as an all-day or timed task) and sync the updated dates back to your CalDAV server in real-time.
- **Task Creation**: Create new unscheduled CalDAV tasks directly in the backlog sidebar by choosing your CalDAV calendar from the creation source dropdown.
- **Linked Notes**: Clicking the note icon next to a CalDAV task in the backlog will automatically generate and open a local linked markdown note in Obsidian using your configured templates, allowing you to attach rich local notes and details to remote tasks.

The global **Linked Note Link Strategy** also applies to CalDAV tasks. Name-based mode reuses the exact task-title file across reschedules and recurring occurrences; deadline-based mode keeps dated occurrence notes separate.

!!! note "Task identity during write-back"
    Full Calendar stores calendar appointments as `VEVENT` and tasks as `VTODO`. An all-day task remains a task when it is created, renamed, or rescheduled through Obsidian; `all-day` controls placement only and does not convert the item into an event. Changing an event into a task replaces its `VEVENT` representation with `VTODO`; changing it back writes `VEVENT` again.

### Linked Task Date Properties

Linked notes for scheduled CalDAV tasks automatically receive managed date properties:

```yaml
scheduled: 2026-04-23
scheduled-link: "[[2026-04-23]]"
due: 2026-04-24
due-link: "[[2026-04-24]]"
```

The `scheduled` and `due` values are ISO dates. The corresponding `-link` values are daily-note links. The outer quotes are YAML syntax and prevent Obsidian from interpreting the wiki-link as a nested list; the property value itself is `[[2026-04-23]]`.

These properties are updated when the task is rescheduled or synchronized from CalDAV. When a task becomes unscheduled, only these managed date properties are removed. Other frontmatter and note content are left unchanged.

## Apple Calendar

In order to use your [iCloud Calendar](https://www.icloud.com/calendar), you'll first need to create an [app-specific password](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204397). Armed with that info and the calendar specific url (given below), you can now add your private Apple Calendars.

### Advanced Setup with Specific Calendar URL

You can create a URL string of the format `https://p[rn]-caldav.icloud.com/[dsid]/calendars/[pGuid]` by using the developer tools (e.g., Safari Dev Tools) on a Mac while logged into your iCloud Calendar web interface to capture the network requests. More info can be found [here](https://sdoerner.de/2024/05/07/import-apple-icloud-calendars-with-caldav/).

Your URL should look something like this:
`https://p37-caldav.icloud.com/8172357017/calendars/2AC2AE2B4-94BE-4DB8-9078-C6907C5E3388`

> Thanks to [@FlyByNite17](https://github.com/FlyByNite17) ([Issue #211](https://github.com/obsidian-full-calendar-remastered/plugin-full-calendar/issues/211)) for the iCloud url docs.

## Fastmail

In order to set up Fastmail, you'll want to set the calendar dropdown to `CalDAV` and click the add button to open the setup dialog.

To continue, we'll need to fill out a few fields.

### Username

This is just your email address, whether it's an `@fastmail.com` address or a custom domain. If in doubt, such as if you have a sub account within a Fastmail organisation, you can confirm your address by logging into the web UI and checking the address listed in the top left corner.

### Password

As above, you'll want to make an [app password](https://www.fastmail.help/hc/en-us/articles/360058752854-App-passwords) to populate your calendar by navigating to `Settings` -> `Passwords & Security` -> `Third-party apps (Manage)` and creating a new password.

Under the `Access` dropdown, you can create a password restricted to the `Calendars (CalDAV)` scope.

### URL

We need to deviate a bit from the [official Fastmail documentation](https://www.fastmail.help/hc/en-us/articles/1500000278342-Server-names-and-ports) here and reference the specific calendar endpoint for your account.

If your email address used in the `Username` section is `user@example.com`, then your URL field will need to look like so:

```
https://caldav.fastmail.com/dav/principals/user/user@example.com/
```


If in doubt, you can find the specific URL by navigating to `Settings` -> `Calendars` and then click `Export` on any of the calendars you have.

Under `CalDAV URL`, you can copy the URL but make sure you **only** copy up to the trailing slash after your email address as shown in the codeblock just above.
