# Calendar Sources Settings

!!! abstract "Philosophy"
    Manage where your events come from. Full Calendar can aggregate data from your local vault, external cloud providers, and other Obsidian plugins into a single unified view.

## Source Management

Access these settings in **Full Calendar Settings → Calendar Sources**.

### Local Vault Sources

*   **Full Note Calendar**: Point this to a folder in your vault. Every `.md` file in this folder with appropriate frontmatter becomes an event. See: [Full Note Calendar Guide](../calendars/local.md).
*   **Daily Note Calendar**: Link to your Daily Notes folder. When adding the source, choose the heading to write under and the timed-event write format (`Default` or `DayPlanner Format`). Parsing supports both formats automatically. See: [Daily Note Calendar Guide](../calendars/dailynote.md).

### Remote Cloud Sources

*   **Google Calendar**: 
    *   **Standard Setup**: Connect using the built-in [OAuth flow](../calendars/gcal.md).
    *   **Custom Client**: Enable `Use custom Google client` to provide your own `Client ID` and `Client Secret` for increased privacy or rate-limit control.
*   **CalDAV**: Connect to iCloud, Nextcloud, or Fastmail. See: [CalDAV Setup](../calendars/caldav.md).
*   **CalDAV Tasks**: Connect a VTODO task/reminder collection, including iCloud Reminders. See: [CalDAV Tasks](../calendars/caldav-tasks.md).
*   **ICS (Remote/Local)**: 
    *   **Remote**: Provide a public or secret `.ics` URL.
    *   **Local**: Provide a path to a `.ics` file stored within your Obsidian vault. See: [ICS Guide](../calendars/ics.md).

### Plugin Integrations

*   **Tasks Plugin**: Enable to pull tasks into your calendar. See: [Tasks Integration](../calendars/tasks-plugin-integration.md).
    *   **Date Mapping**: Choose which task date to use: `Scheduled`, `Due`, or `Start`.
    *   **Backlog Behavior**: Enable `Open edit modal after backlog drop` to immediately refine tasks dragged onto the calendar.
*   **TaskNotes Plugin**: Enable to sync scheduled TaskNotes tasks into your calendar. See: [TaskNotes Integration](../calendars/tasknotes.md).
    *   **NLP Endpoint Mode**: Configure whether NLP creation opens `Search + Create` (default) or `Direct Create`.
    *   **Integration Visibility**: TaskNotes Integration always appears in **Settings → Integrations** and will prompt you to add a TaskNotes source if one is missing.
*   **ActivityWatch**: Sync your system activity as background events. See: [ActivityWatch Integration](../calendars/activitywatch.md).
    *   **API URL**: Defaults to `http://127.0.0.1:5600`.
    *   **Sync Strategy**: Choose `Auto` or `Custom` date ranges.
    *   **Profiles**: Create matching rules to categorize raw ActivityWatch data into meaningful calendar events.

## Global Source Settings

*   **Default Calendar**: Choose which calendar is selected by default when creating a new event via the UI or [FCR Command](../features/nlp.md). Only calendars that accept new events are listed. Individual [Workspaces](workspaces.md) can override this; leave it on *First available calendar* to keep the previous behavior of selecting the first writable source.

    !!! note "Falls back automatically"
        If the chosen calendar is later deleted, becomes read-only, or is hidden by the active workspace, the plugin falls back to the workspace default, then the global default, then the first writable calendar the active workspace can display. This applies to events created from the calendar UI and from [FCR Commands](../features/nlp.md) alike.
*   **Linked Note Link Strategy**:
    * `Name-based`: Reuse or create the exact sanitized event-title file in the configured linked-notes folder. Existing matching files keep their body and unrelated properties; no collision suffix is added.
    * `Deadline-based`: Keep separate notes for dated recurring occurrences, using occurrence identity and collision-safe filenames.
*   **Revalidate Remote Calendars**: Manually trigger a refresh of all external feeds.
*   **Reset Event Cache**: A deep reload that forces the plugin to re-read all data from all sources. See [Data Integrity](../reference/data_integrity.md).
