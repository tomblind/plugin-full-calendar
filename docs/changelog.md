-   **Tasks Time Features** ([#227](https://github.com/obsidian-full-calendar-remastered/plugin-full-calendar/issues/227))  
    _Tasks can now have an optional time block._
    -   Add drag-drop task time block updates. Dragging to a time updates the start time; dragging to all-day removes it.

-   **CalDAV enhancements** ([#230](https://github.com/obsidian-full-calendar-remastered/plugin-full-calendar/issues/230))  
    _Auto-fetch calendar name and color when importing a collection, and correctly validate it._

-   **Advanced Categorization enhancements** ([#222](https://github.com/obsidian-full-calendar-remastered/plugin-full-calendar/issues/222), [#231](https://github.com/obsidian-full-calendar-remastered/plugin-full-calendar/issues/231))  
    _More robust advanced categorization workflows._
    -   Added "Disable without cleanup" option to advanced categorization modal.


-   **Robust timezone handling for recurring/all-day events** ([#194](https://github.com/obsidian-full-calendar-remastered/plugin-full-calendar/issues/194), [#223](https://github.com/obsidian-full-calendar-remastered/plugin-full-calendar/issues/223), [#231](https://github.com/obsidian-full-calendar-remastered/plugin-full-calendar/issues/231))  
    _Timezone handling has been further hardened._
    -   Prevent `RRULE TZID` one-day date shift when recurring.
    -   Prevent timezone shift for all-day date-only events (floating dates).

-   **Provider file sync refactor** ([#224](https://github.com/obsidian-full-calendar-remastered/plugin-full-calendar/issues/224))  
    _Refactored `ProviderRegistry` file delete handling during rename races. Fixed `FullNoteProvider` rename logic to avoid `ENOENT` errors._

-   **Remote Payload Hardening** ([#218](https://github.com/obsidian-full-calendar-remastered/plugin-full-calendar/issues/218))  
    _Handle null-body statuses and fail fast on malformed CalDAV xml payloads to prevent ghost syncing issues._

-   **UI, Workspaces & Localization**  
    _Desktop and mobile UI responsiveness updates. Workspace calendar filters now show user-defined calendar names making it easier to distinguish when you have multiples of the same source. Updated ES/FR/IT translations._

---

## v0.12.7.1

-   **Asynchronous Event Discovery Pipeline**  
    _The core synchronization engine has been rewritten to eliminate UI freezes and dramatically improve load performance._
    -   Re-architected `ProviderRegistry` remote discovery into a true Stage 1 → Stage 2 pipeline.
    -   Stage 2 for each provider now begins immediately after its own Stage 1 completes, removing the previous global Promise barrier.
    -   Enables background pipelining and significantly reduces perceived startup time.

-   **Local Provider Concurrency**  
    _Improved I/O throughput and removed unnecessary blocking during startup._
    -   Parallelized Local Provider Stage 1 reads using `Promise.all` instead of sequential `for..of` iteration.
    -   Prevents main-thread stalls during large vault scans.

-   **EventCache Optimization**  
    _Removed expensive diffing operations that caused major slowdowns on large datasets._
    -   Eliminated O(N) `JSON.stringify` comparisons in `EventCache.syncCalendar` when cache size changes significantly (e.g., Stage 2 replacing Stage 1 data).
    -   Added short-circuit invalidation logic to bypass redundant comparisons.

-   **Selective UI Reconciliation**  
    _Replaced full calendar teardown cycles with targeted updates._
    -   Updated `EventCache` and `CalendarView` flush callbacks to accept an `affectedCalendars` array.
    -   Replaced `removeAllEventSources()` with selective `removeEventSource` / `addEventSource` operations for dirty calendars only.
    -   Fully resolves prior 1–3 second UI freezes during large refreshes.

-   **DailyNoteProvider Algorithm Fix**  
    _Eliminated a critical O(N²) bottleneck in event resolution._
    -   Removed full Vault Daily Note cache iteration from `getEventHandle`.
    -   Events now resolve purely by date string.
    -   `ProviderRegistry` securely injects authoritative `location.path` metadata before write/delete operations.

-   **Performance Audit Results**  
    _Benchmark run on 1000+ Daily Note events and 69 Google Calendar events._
    -   Daily Note Stage 1: 1209.1ms → 110.8ms (~11x faster)
    -   Daily Note Stage 2: 2839.4ms → 143.3ms (~20x faster)
    -   Remote Stage timings remain steady while now starting earlier in the pipeline.
    -   Total two-stage discovery: 4880.9ms → 908.9ms (>5x faster overall)
    -   Complete elimination of observable main-thread UI freezing on load.

-   **Linting & Type Safety**  
    _Strengthened long-term maintainability and compliance._
    -   Enforced ESLint rules for UI string formatting consistency.
    -   Improved TypeScript type safety across core components.
    -   Refactored related modules to align with stricter linting and safer type contracts.

---

## v0.12.7

-   **Local ICS Support**  
    _You can now view `.ics` files stored directly in your Obsidian vault!_
    -   Added a mode toggle for standard Web URLs versus Vault relative files.
    -   Extended provider interfaces to safely support the `app.vault` API.

-   **Timezone & DST Hardening** ([#194](https://github.com/obsidian-full-calendar-remastered/plugin-full-calendar/issues/194))  
    _The timezone pipeline has been modularized and significantly hardened for recurring events crossing Daylight Saving Time boundaries._
    -   Removed `luxon` entirely in favor of native and internal logic.
    -   Corrected floating time expansion, EU/US DST transitions, and half-hour/45-min offset zones.
    -   Restored dynamic display timezone toggles.
    -   Fixed missing DTSTART/EXDATE alignment in RRule passthrough.

-   **Staged Loading Architecture**  
    _Dramatic startup performance and UI responsiveness improvements._
    -   Providers now load events in two stages: Stage 1 quickly fetches a 3-month window surrounding the current date, while Stage 2 quietly loads the full history in the background.
    -   Eliminates UI locking when CalDAV or Google APIs stall or time out on huge event caches.

-   **Linting & Code Quality**  
    _The codebase has been migrated to standard `eslint.config.mjs` and native `eslint-plugin-obsidianmd`._
    -   Refactored 80+ warnings across 18 core files.
    -   Eliminated thousands of unsafe `any` usages and tightened type safety for caching and Google Auth.
    -   Safeguarded tests with mocked vaults and standard JS generic mocks.

-   **General UI Fixes** ([#169](https://github.com/obsidian-full-calendar-remastered/plugin-full-calendar/issues/169), [#191](https://github.com/obsidian-full-calendar-remastered/plugin-full-calendar/issues/191), [#214](https://github.com/obsidian-full-calendar-remastered/plugin-full-calendar/issues/214), [#218](https://github.com/obsidian-full-calendar-remastered/plugin-full-calendar/issues/218))  
    _Fixed LiveSync header injections by targeting `contentEl`, improved mobile responsiveness across fullcalendar views, improved edit modal error namespace, and added proper API error handling for HTTP POST timeouts._

    -   Updated `CONTRIBUTING.md` standards.

---


## v0.12.5

-   **CalDAV validation and parsing** ([#193](https://github.com/obsidian-full-calendar-remastered/plugin-full-calendar/issues/193))  
    _CalDAVProvider now validates calendar collections with PROPFIND, parses calendar-data via DOMParser, adds JSDOM-backed tests, and surfaces clearer errors when a URL is not a calendar collection._

-   **Provider initialization and cache refresh** ([#173](https://github.com/obsidian-full-calendar-remastered/plugin-full-calendar/issues/173))  
    _Providers call initialize() after construction, load events into the cache with completion callbacks, adjust load priorities, and resync event sources without a full calendar rebuild._

-   **Google auth and recurring timezone handling** ([#191](https://github.com/obsidian-full-calendar-remastered/plugin-full-calendar/issues/191), [#190](https://github.com/obsidian-full-calendar-remastered/plugin-full-calendar/issues/190), [#94](https://github.com/obsidian-full-calendar-remastered/plugin-full-calendar/issues/94))  
    _Mobile OAuth opens windows synchronously to avoid popup blockers; recurring Google events now honor exdates and BYDAY across timezones, correctly hiding deleted instances and preserving durations across DST._

-   **ChronoAnalyser data integrity and Bases provider**

    _Provider registry logic has been improved for better calendar source management and error handling. Adding new calendar types is now simpler and safer._

-   **Documentation and Translation Files**  
    _Updated documentation and added instructions for contributing new translations. See [i18n documentation](user/features/i18n.md)._ 

---


## v0.12.3.1-beta

-   **Tasks Provider Rearchitected for Performance and Precision** ([#151](https://github.com/obsidian-full-calendar-remastered/plugin-full-calendar/issues/151), [#155](https://github.com/obsidian-full-calendar-remastered/plugin-full-calendar/issues/155))  
    _The Tasks provider is now powered by the official Tasks plugin's live cache, eliminating manual vault scans and delivering instant updates. Edits are now "surgical," preserving user metadata like links, tags, and comments when scheduling or completing tasks._

-   **Robust and Stable Settings UI** ([#141](https://github.com/obsidian-full-calendar-remastered/plugin-full-calendar/issues/141))  
    _The settings panel has been refactored for stability. The color picker no longer loses focus on changes, and a new `CalendarSettingRow` component ensures a consistent and reliable layout for all calendar sources._

    _Remote ICS calendars with unrecognized timezones will now safely fall back to UTC instead of failing to load._

---


## v0.12.3

-   **Deep Tasks Integration with Backlog & Filtering** ([#122](https://github.com/obsidian-full-calendar-remastered/plugin-full-calendar/issues/122), [#128](https://github.com/obsidian-full-calendar-remastered/plugin-full-calendar/issues/128), [#136](https://github.com/obsidian-full-calendar-remastered/plugin-full-calendar/issues/136))  
    _Full Calendar now has first-class support for the Obsidian Tasks plugin. A new "Tasks" calendar source syncs your tasks directly onto the calendar. Features include a dedicated task backlog, drag-and-drop rescheduling, and in-calendar completion. Create, update, and delete tasks without leaving the calendar view._

-   **Advanced Date Navigation** ([#106](https://github.com/obsidian-full-calendar-remastered/plugin-full-calendar/issues/106))  
    _Navigate your calendar with precision using the new "Go To" dropdown in the toolbar. It features a reusable `DatePicker` and context-aware navigation. Right-click on the calendar to jump to a specific month, week, or day._

    _Fixed numerous bugs, including a race condition when removing event sources, an issue preventing the create modal from appearing if no editable calendars exist, and a bug where the Daily Notes calendar would fail without a template. New calendars now appear instantly in settings without a "Provider not found" flash._

---


## v0.12.2 (beta)

-   **Multi-day Daily Note events with explicit endDate**  
    _Daily Note calendar now supports explicit multi‑day events via `[endDate:: YYYY-MM-DD]` while remaining backward compatible with legacy overnight detection._

-   **Central TimeEngine**  
    _Single timer maintains a sorted time-sensitive cache and publishes a `time-tick` event consumed by status bar, notifications, and other listeners._

-   **Interactive time‑axis zoom** ([#96](https://github.com/obsidian-full-calendar-remastered/plugin-full-calendar/issues/96))  
    _Ctrl/Cmd + scroll to dynamically zoom the vertical (timeGrid) or horizontal (resourceTimeline) axis for fast focus changes._

-   **Advanced recurrence intervals & positional monthly rules** ([#97](https://github.com/obsidian-full-calendar-remastered/plugin-full-calendar/issues/97))  
    _Support for interval-based repeats (e.g., every 2 weeks) and positional monthly rules (2nd Tuesday, last Friday) with iCal import/export parity._

-   **Codebase compliance & safety**  
    _Replaced loose `any` casts, moved inline styles to CSS, added `instanceof` guards for file/folder objects, removed custom leaf detaching on unload._

-   **Reactive calendar view lifecycle**  
    _`view-config-changed` now triggers targeted cache repopulation and a new `resync` event prompts precise re-renders for snappier UI updates._

-   **NotificationManager refactor**  
    _No internal timer; now a passive subscriber to `TimeEngine`, reducing duplicate intervals and simplifying lifecycle management._

-   **Robust timezone conversion for cross-day events**  
    _`convertEvent` rewritten as a pure function; correctly handles explicit `endDate` and legacy overnight semantics with stricter type guards._

---


## v0.12.1 (beta)

-   **Event Reminder System with Desktop Notifications (BETA)**  
    _Introducing the `NotificationManager` for native desktop notifications. Users can opt-in to receive reminders 10 minutes before events start and, optionally, 10 minutes before they end. Perfect for never missing important meetings or deadlines._

-   **Multi-Account Google Calendar Integration**  
    _Google Calendar integration now supports connecting and managing multiple accounts simultaneously. Features a dedicated account management hub with a streamlined two-step wizard for adding new calendars from any connected account._

-   **Provider-Based Architecture with Multi-Account Support**  
    _Complete architectural overhaul to a provider-based system where each calendar source (Local, Daily Notes, ICS, CalDAV, Google) is a self-contained, instanced provider. The new `ProviderRegistry` acts as a central persistence gateway, managing all I/O and abstracting storage details. This enables stateful features and robust multi-account Google Calendar integration._

-   **Event-Driven Settings with Instant Updates**  
    _Settings persistence refactored to a publish/subscribe model. The `saveSettings` function now diffs old vs new state and publishes granular events (`sources-changed`, `view-config-changed`, `settings-updated`). Calendar views re-render instantly without flicker or unnecessary reloads._

-   **Lazy-Loading for Faster Startup Performance**  
    _Heavy dependencies are now dynamically imported only when needed: FullCalendar engine loads when opening a calendar view, React modals load on demand. This dramatically reduces startup time and memory usage._

-   **Centralized Event Enhancement Pipeline**  
    _New `EventEnhancer` module centralizes all timezone conversions and category parsing, essentially intercepting all raw events befor it reaches the Cache. Business logic extracted into dedicated stateless modules with a new `WorkspaceManager` handling all workspace filtering and display logic._

-   **Timezone Handling for Recurring Events** [#94](https://github.com/obsidian-full-calendar-remastered/plugin-full-calendar/issues/94)  
    _Recurring events now properly handle timezones with endDate support, resolving timezone branching issues and ensuring correct time display across different time zones._

-   **ICS events now loads properly** [#91](https://github.com/obsidian-full-calendar-remastered/plugin-full-calendar/issues/91)  
    _Parsing issues in Remote ICS calendar is fixed and should now load properly._

---

## v0.11.9

-   **Calendar Workspaces** ([#90](https://github.com/obsidian-full-calendar-remastered/plugin-full-calendar/issues/90))  
    _Save and switch between customized calendar setups (sources, filters, and view preferences). Workspaces include a header switcher, a command palette action ("Full Calendar: Switch Workspace"), and an optional default workspace on startup. Saved state covers selected sources (Local, Daily Notes, ICS, CalDAV, Google), category/sub‑category filters, tasks visibility, all‑day toggle, initial view (month/week/day/timeline), week start, and time‑grid display options._

-   **Faster Switching and Rendering**  
    _Workspace application is incremental (sources → filters → view) to avoid full calendar rebuilds. Switching preserves context where possible (e.g., scroll/selection) and significantly improves responsiveness on large vaults._

-   **Workspace Management UX**  
    _Add Save as Workspace, Rename, Delete in the calendar header menu; set a Default Workspace in Settings; and assign hotkeys through Obsidian’s Hotkeys for one‑press switching._

-   **Edit Modal Sub‑category Parsing**  
    _Fixes a regression where sub‑categories could disappear when editing the title in the modal. The title parser now consistently preserves the `Category - SubCategory - Title` format on save._

-   **Workspace Persistence Edge Cases**  
    _Improved robustness when loading a workspace that references a removed or renamed source. Adds safe fallbacks to an "All Events" view and clearer status messaging._

---

## v0.11.8

-   **Business Hours and Background Events Support**  
    _Highlight working hours in calendar views and display events as background highlights (e.g., vacations or focus blocks). Configurable via settings and event frontmatter._

-   **Timeline View Category Shadow Events** ([#76](https://github.com/obsidian-full-calendar-remastered/plugin-full-calendar/issues/76))  
    _Adds optional display of category shadow events in Timeline View for better visual context and planning._

-   **Real-Time Duplicate Event Validation** ([#67](https://github.com/obsidian-full-calendar-remastered/plugin-full-calendar/issues/67))  
    _Prevents creation of duplicate events in the calendar interface, improving scheduling accuracy._

-   **Edit Modal Now Supports Subcategory Editing**  
    _The "Edit Event" modal now parses and displays sub-categories directly in the event title. Users can edit them inline and changes are preserved._

-   **Settings Modal Reorganization and Footer**  
    _UI updates include reorganized settings for better clarity, hover hints for display options, and a new footer for versioning and help links._

-   **Configuration Migration for Legacy Support**  
    _Legacy settings like `subprojectKeywords_exclude` are migrated automatically, and missing fields (e.g., `persona`) are filled safely._

-   **Type Safety and Safer DOM Manipulations** ([#69](https://github.com/obsidian-full-calendar-remastered/plugin-full-calendar/issues/69), [#71](https://github.com/obsidian-full-calendar-remastered/plugin-full-calendar/issues/71))  
    _Removed unsafe type assertions across key modules (`DailyNoteCalendar`, `GoogleCalendar`, `interop`) and introduced robust DOM update utilities (`safeCreateEl`, `safeEmpty`)._

-   **Recurring Task Completion Preserves Child Timing** ([#75](https://github.com/obsidian-full-calendar-remastered/plugin-full-calendar/issues/75))  
    _Undoing completed recurring tasks now correctly retains the timing of override events. Adds full test coverage for various edge cases._

-   **All-Day Events Treated as Floating in RRULE**  
    _All-day recurring events now behave correctly as floating events, fixing unintended start time offsets._

-   **Coverage for Business Hours, Background Events, and Override Logic**  
    _New test suites validate schema correctness, UI rendering, and recurring timing behavior._

---

## v0.11.7

-   **Full Google Calendar Integration with Two‑Way Sync**  
    _Connect your Google account to create, modify, and delete events (including recurring events) directly in Obsidian. Includes OAuth 2.0 authentication, calendar selection, and proper token refresh handling._

-   **Centralized and Reusable Form Components**  
    _Inputs like URL, Username, Password, Directory Select, and Heading have been refactored into dual‑mode primitives with a `readOnly` mode for consistent display. A generic `TextInput` replaces one‑off components._

-   **Modularized Settings Tab and Changelog Component**  
    _Settings sections are now organized into dedicated renderers with improved type safety. A new `Changelog.tsx` component has been added for clearer update visibility._

-   **Unified Event Parsing Pipeline**  
    _Calendar parsers now output raw events without settings dependencies and pass them through a single `enhanceEvent` function for category logic. Tests have been updated to separately verify raw parsing and enhancement._

-   **Modular Event Cache Management**  
    _The `EventCache` logic is split into dedicated modules (`RemoteCacheUpdater`, `LocalCacheUpdater`, `IdentifierManager`, `RecurringEventManager`), making synchronization and recurring event handling more reliable._

    _Shared types and utilities have been centralized, internal names clarified, and redundant code removed—all without changing user‑facing behavior._

    _Events can now be organized by categories and sub-categories in a new Resource Timeline view. Expandable groups and aggregated parent rows make it easier to manage complex schedules._

    _Deleting a recurring event now asks whether to remove just one instance, the entire series, or promote existing edits to standalone events._

-   **Better Task Behavior for Repeating Events**  
    _Recurring tasks now behave just like regular ones — you can check them off individually, and they show up correctly in the calendar._

-   **Multi-day all-day events fix by @yalikebaz**  
    _Multi-day all-day events made inclusive for local calendars. Thanks to @yalikebaz for the fix!_
